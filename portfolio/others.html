<h3>Civil Engineering</h3>
<p>
    I am currently pursuing my Civil Engineering degree from
    <a href="http://jecjabalpur.ac.in">Govt. Engineering College, Jabalpur</a>.
    I will be graduated with a BE degree in Civil Engineering in June of 2019(if I have
    not).

<h3>Project Organiser</h3>
<p>
    Though I do not have any professional experience in this
    field but I like to study ways to organise and prepare teams
    for projects. I always prefer <b>Scrum</b> methodology to
    setup road-maps and sometimes <b>agile-like</b> system.
